//! A buffer is a memory location accessible to the video card.
//!
//! The purpose of buffers is to serve as a space where the GPU can read from or write data to.
//! It can contain a list of vertices, indices, uniform data, etc.
//!
//! # Buffers management in glium
//!
//! There are three levels of abstraction in glium:
//!
//!  - An `Alloc` corresponds to an OpenGL buffer object and is unsafe to use.
//!    This type is not public.
//!  - A `Buffer` wraps around an `Alloc` and provides safety by handling the data type and fences.
//!  - The `VertexBuffer`, `IndexBuffer`, `UniformBuffer`, `PixelBuffer`, etc. types are
//!    abstractions over a `Buffer` indicating their specific purpose. They implement `Deref`
//!    for the `Buffer`. These types are in the `vertex`, `index`, etc. modules.
//!
//! # Unsized types
//!
//! In order to put some data in a buffer, it must implement the `Content` trait. This trait is
//! automatically implemented on all `Sized` types and on slices (like `[u8]`). This means that
//! you can create a `Buffer<Foo>` (if `Foo` is sized) or a `Buffer<[u8]>` for example without
//! worrying about it.
//!
//! However unsized structs don't automatically implement this trait and you must call the
//! `implement_buffer_content!` macro on them. You must then use the `empty_unsized` constructor.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate glium; fn main() {
//! # use std::mem;
//! # use glium::buffer::{BufferType, BufferMode};
//! # let display: glium::Display = unsafe { mem::uninitialized() };
//! struct Data {
//!     data: [f32],        // `[f32]` is unsized, therefore `Data` is unsized too
//! }
//!
//! implement_buffer_content!(Data);    // without this, you can't put `Data` in a glium buffer
//!
//! // creates a buffer of 64 bytes, which thus holds 8 f32s
//! let mut buffer = glium::buffer::Buffer::<Data>::empty_unsized(&display, BufferType::UniformBuffer,
//!                                                               64, BufferMode::Default).unwrap();
//!
//! // you can then write to it like you normally would
//! buffer.map().data[4] = 2.1;
//! # }
//! ```
